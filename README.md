# Terminus
A little Go framework for making interactive terminal based games/apps.

```
Terminal Menus => Term Menus => termmenus => terminus (Because why not?)
```

Depends heavily on https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go


## TODOs
* Better go doc
* Colors
* Mouse Support
* Figure out how to mock termbox and test more of this
